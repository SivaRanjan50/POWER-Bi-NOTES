*4️⃣ What is Power Query?*
Power Query is a data connection and transformation tool used in Power BI to import, clean, and reshape data from various sources before loading it into the model. It uses the M language and provides a no-code editor for ETL operations.

*5️⃣ What is DAX in Power BI?*  
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI for creating custom calculations, measures, and calculated columns. It is essential for data modeling and creating business logic inside the report.

*6️⃣ What are measures and calculated columns?*  
Measures: Calculations evaluated at query time (e.g., SUM of sales). Created using DAX. Used in visuals.  
Calculated Columns: New data columns added to tables. Evaluated during data load or refresh. Used for data transformation.

*7️⃣ How do you create relationships between tables?*  
Relationships are created in the Model view by dragging one column (usually a key) to a matching column in another table. You can also define them manually by selecting:  
- Primary & foreign keys  
- Cardinality (One-to-One, One-to-Many)  
- Cross-filter direction (Single/Both)

*8️⃣ What is a data model?*
A data model is the structured combination of tables, relationships, and business logic (DAX measures, calculated columns) within Power BI that defines how data is stored, connected, and queried for reporting.

*9️⃣ What are slicers in Power BI?*  
Slicers are visual filters in Power BI reports that allow users to select values and dynamically filter other visuals. They provide an intuitive way to control which data is displayed (e.g., filter by year or region).

*🔟 Difference between slicers and filters*  
Slicers: Visual elements placed on reports; end-users can interact with them. Visible on the report page.  
Filters: Applied in the filter pane (visual-level, page-level, report-level); not always visible to users.

*11. What is a dashboard vs a report?*  
- *Report*: A multi-page, detailed view of your data with multiple visuals per page. Built in Power BI Desktop.
- *Dashboard*: A single-page summary of visuals *pinned* from reports. Created in Power BI Service.

*12. How do you publish a report to the Power BI Service?*  
- Click *Publish* in Power BI Desktop → Sign in → Select your workspace.  
- The report uploads to *Power BI Service* for sharing, scheduling, and dashboard creation.

*13. What is Power BI Gateway?*  
- A *bridge* between on-premises data and the Power BI Service.  
- Two types:  
  - *Personal Gateway* (for individual use)  
  - *Standard Gateway* (for team/shared use)  

*14. Explain row-level security in Power BI*  
- Limits data *visibility* for users based on roles.  
- You define *roles* with DAX filters (e.g., `Region = "West"`) in Desktop, then assign users to roles in Service.

*15. What is a bookmark?*  
- Saves the *current state* of a report page (filters, visuals, selections).  
- Useful for navigation, storytelling, or toggling views.

*16. How do you schedule data refresh in Power BI?*  
- In Power BI Service:  
  - Go to the dataset → *Schedule refresh*
- Set frequency, time, and configure credentials if needed (Gateway required for on-prem data).

*17. What are visuals in Power BI?*  
- Graphical representations of data (bar charts, line graphs, maps, cards, etc.).  
- Custom visuals can also be imported for advanced scenarios.

*18. How can you import data into Power BI?*  
- Use *Get Data* → choose sources: Excel, SQL Server, Web, APIs, etc.  
- Data is then transformed via *Power Query* and loaded into the model.

*19. What is the difference between DirectQuery and Import mode?*  
- *Import*: Data is cached into Power BI → Faster but requires refreshes.  
- *DirectQuery*: Queries data live from the source → Slower, but always current.

*20. What is drillthrough and drilldown?*  
- *Drillthrough*: Navigate to a new page filtered by selected value (e.g., click a region → open region detail page).  
- *Drilldown*: Explore data hierarchy within the same visual (e.g., year → quarter → month).  

*21. What are custom visuals in Power BI?*  
Custom visuals are user-created or third-party visuals beyond the default ones in Power BI (e.g., Sankey charts, heat maps). They can be downloaded from Microsoft AppSource or imported via `.pbiviz` files to meet specific business visualization needs.

*22. How do you optimize Power BI performance?*  
- Use star schema for modeling  
- Remove unused columns  
- Reduce cardinality  
- Prefer Import mode over DirectQuery (if possible)  
- Use variables in DAX to avoid repeated calculations  
- Disable auto date/time in load options  
- Avoid bi-directional relationships unless necessary  

*23. What is the difference between ALL and ALLEXCEPT in DAX?*  
- `ALL()` removes filters from all columns or a table.  
- `ALLEXCEPT()` removes filters from all columns except the specified ones.  
*Example:*  
```DAX
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales), ALL(Region)) -- Ignores Region filter  
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales), ALLEXCEPT(Sales, Product)) -- Ignores all filters except Product
```

*24. What is the CALCULATE function in DAX?*  
`CALCULATE()` modifies the context of a calculation by applying filters. It’s used to create dynamic measures.  
*Example:*  
```DAX
Sales_North = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Region = "North")
```

*25. What is the difference between SUMX and SUM?*  
- `SUM()` adds up a single column.  
- `SUMX()` adds up the result of a row-wise expression.  
*Example:*  
```DAX
SUM(Sales[Revenue])  
SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Price])
```

*26. How do you handle null or blank values in Power BI?*  
Use DAX functions:  
- `IF(ISBLANK([Column]), "N/A", [Column])`  
- `COALESCE([Column], 0)`  
You can also filter or replace blanks using Power Query.

*27. What is the RELATED function in DAX?*  
`RELATED()` fetches values from a related table based on relationships.  
*Example:*  
```DAX
RELATED(Product[Category]) -- Gets category name from related Product table
```

*28. What is a star schema vs snowflake schema?*  
- *Star schema:* Central fact table with denormalized dimension tables  
- *Snowflake schema:* Dimension tables are normalized (broken into sub-tables)  
Star schema is preferred in Power BI for simplicity and performance.

*29. What is Power BI Embedded?*  
Power BI Embedded is a Microsoft Azure service that allows developers to embed interactive Power BI visuals and reports into custom applications (web/apps) using APIs and SDKs.

*30. What are KPIs and how do you create them?*
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are metrics that track performance against goals. In Power BI, you can create KPIs using measures and visuals like KPI cards or conditional formatting based on thresholds.  
*Example:* Sales vs Target with colored indicators.

*31. What are tooltips in Power BI?*  
Tooltips are small popups that appear when you hover over a data point on a visual. They provide additional context, like values or percentages. You can also create custom tooltip pages to show charts or extra info on hover.

*32. How do you use variables in DAX?*  
Variables improve readability and performance in DAX. They are declared using `VAR` and returned using `RETURN`.  
Example:  
```DAX
VAR TotalSales = SUM(Sales[Amount])  
RETURN TotalSales * 0.1
```

*33. What are quick measures?*  
Quick measures are pre-built DAX calculations that can be created using the UI without writing complex DAX. Example: running totals, percent of grand total, year-to-date, etc.

*34. What is the use of FORMAT() in DAX?*  
`FORMAT()` changes the appearance of a value without changing its data type.  
Example:  
```DAX
FORMAT(TODAY(), "DD-MM-YYYY") // "21-12-2025"
```

*35. What is a calculated table?*  
A calculated table is created using a DAX formula instead of being loaded from a data source. It's useful for intermediate tables, like date tables or filtered subsets.  
Example:  
```DAX
TopCustomers = FILTER(Sales, Sales[Amount] > 1000)
```
*36. How do you apply conditional formatting in visuals?*  
Conditional formatting allows you to change colors, font, or icons based on field values. You can apply it in tables, matrices, or bar charts via the visual formatting pane.

*37. What are the different types of filters in Power BI?*  
- Visual-level filter  
- Page-level filter  
- Report-level filter  
- Drillthrough filter  
Each applies to a different scope in the report.

*38. What is a hierarchy in Power BI?*  
A hierarchy organizes data in levels (e.g., Year > Quarter > Month). It enables drilldown functionality in visuals.

*39. How does Power BI handle large datasets?*  
Power BI uses compression, aggregations, and in-memory storage. You can improve performance with DirectQuery, incremental refresh, and data modeling techniques.

*40. What is Incremental Refresh?*  
It updates only new or changed data instead of reloading the entire dataset. This is crucial for large datasets and improves refresh performance.

*41. How do you share reports securely in Power BI?*  
You can share via Power BI Service using:  
- Workspace access  
- Report sharing links with permissions  
- Power BI Apps  
- Embedding in Teams or SharePoint  
Use Row-Level Security (RLS) and role-based access for added protection.

*42. What are Dataflows in Power BI?*  
Dataflows allow users to create reusable ETL pipelines in the Power BI Service. They use Power Query online and store data in Azure Data Lake.

*43. What is Q&A in Power BI?*  
Q&A lets users ask natural language questions about data (e.g., "Total sales by region") and get instant visuals. It uses AI to interpret user queries.

*44. What is the DAX function EARLIER() used for?*  
`EARLIER()` is used in row context when you need to refer to an outer row context within a calculated column. It's commonly used in ranking and grouping calculations.

*45. What is the significance of context in DAX?*  
DAX has:
- *Row context:* The current row being evaluated
- *Filter context:* The filters applied from visuals or slicers  
Context affects how calculations are evaluated and returned.

*46. What are parameters in Power BI?*
Parameters allow users to create dynamic filters, data sources, or calculated values. Useful in Power Query and for paginated reports.

*47. What is drillthrough vs drilldown vs drill up?*  
- *Drilldown:* Go deeper into hierarchy (Year → Month)  
- *Drill up:* Move to a higher level in hierarchy  
- *Drillthrough:* Navigate to a new page focused on a single data point

*48. What is report-level filter vs visual-level filter?*  
- *Visual-level:* Affects only one visual  
- *Page-level:* Affects all visuals on a page  
- *Report-level:* Affects visuals across all pages

*49. How do you export data from Power BI?*  
You can export visual data to Excel, CSV, or PDF via:  
- Power BI Service (Export > CSV)  
- Power BI Desktop (Export data from visual options)

*50. Explain a Power BI project you’ve worked on.*  
Example: "Built a sales dashboard integrating data from Excel and SQL Server. Created a star schema, implemented DAX for KPIs, used RLS for secure sharing, and automated data refresh via Gateway."
